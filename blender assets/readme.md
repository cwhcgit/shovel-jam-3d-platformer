hi! chip here! this is mostly just for the nerds that want the actual blend
files lol. everything should be packed and ready to go straight out of the box.
if textures don't load, just export the images from the included psd files as a
png and plug them in.

also important to note: the player model is **FK only.** I really did try to get
IK working for the legs but I am not very smart it seems, so I ditched it.
there's a couple other weird quirks with the rig as well, but they don't really impact useability that much.

but yeah these are free for you to use/modify however you want! credit isn't really
required but I would really appreciate it. if you DO decide to credit, you can
link to my [itch page](https://kitifulninesgames.itch.io), the game's [itch page](https://micearesocute.itch.io/link-unsure-if-confirmed),
or my [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/kitifulnines.com)!

if you modify the rigs or their meshes, you're allowed to distribute those as well if you so choose,
(I would recommend it actually esp for the IK rig), just in that particular instance credit for the original stuff IS required!

I know I could've done better with these but hey I'm primarily a 2D artist,
any 3D practice is good practice in my opinion. I had a blast. go play our game now. bye :3
