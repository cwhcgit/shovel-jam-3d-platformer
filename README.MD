## Bugs/Needs fix

- Character positioning on bed/couch is incorrect
- Sometimes if you use an interactable then immediately stop, the music stays as the elevator music
- greg related
    - greg should more aggressively avoid the world tree
    - greg sometimes can decide to fly into collision objects (mainly the world tree), resulting in it being stuck
    - greg's position when on top of player's head should follow the model, instead of the base node

## Wanted to add...

- green/red arrow indicator when motives (needs) go up/down
- some kind of scoreboard/high score (persist/online)
- more ways to get score (more things to do in the game)
    - grow trees
    - defeat pests
    - ...

## Fun?

Possible to explore more of the base mechanics by adding more interesting platforming movement/mechanics & things to fulfil needs/motive in the overworld. Perhaps defeat enemies, perhaps find/explore items and secrets, etc. Typical platformer/adventure game stuff. Having to maintain more of a list of requirements instead of a single one (food) might be an interesting angle.
